# Single-server-queuing-model

In this project, we delve into a queuing system model designed for airport check-in counters, specifically honing in on challenges stemming from overweight baggage. Leveraging MATLAB, we crunch the numbers to estimate how long passengers can expect to wait and pinpoint any delays arising from these challenges. Our results highlight that disruptions, like overweight baggage, contribute to longer waiting times, emphasizing the importance of enhancing efficiency in handling such situations.
